# Battery Management System - Features Overview

## Implemented Features

### 1. Authentication (JWT)
- **What**: Secure login system with JWT tokens.
- **Why**: Prevents unauthorized access to battery data APIs.
- **How**: Tokens are issued on login, must be included in headers for API requests.

### 2. Data Logging
- **What**: Request and error logging for backend API.
- **Why**: Helps debug issues and monitor usage patterns.
- **How**: Middleware logs incoming requests with timestamps and statuses.

### 3. RESTful APIs
- **What**: CRUD-style APIs to manage battery data.
- **Why**: Standardized structure makes integration easy with mobile/IoT apps.
- **How**: Express routes with controller separation for clarity.

### 4. Database Indexing
- **What**: Indexes on (battery_id, time).
- **Why**: Improves performance for time-series queries.
- **How**: SQL schema includes proper index creation.

### 5. React Dashboard (Chart.js)
- **What**: Visualizes Voltage, Current, and Temperature over time.
- **Why**: Easy to interpret raw data visually.
- **How**: React components render line charts using Chart.js.

### 6. Filters
- **What**: Time range and field selection filters.
- **Why**: Focused insights (e.g., only voltage between certain times).
- **How**: API requests accept `start` and `end` query params.

### 7. Error Handling & Validation
- **What**: Input validation for API payloads.
- **Why**: Protects system from invalid/malicious data.
- **How**: Schema validation with meaningful error responses.

### 8. Dockerized Environment
- **What**: Docker Compose for backend + PostgreSQL + Adminer.
- **Why**: Simplifies installation, consistent across environments.
- **How**: Single command to bring up containers.

### 9. OpenAPI Documentation
- **What**: OpenAPI 3.0 spec for APIs.
- **Why**: Easy to test with Postman or import to Swagger UI.
- **How**: YAML spec included with backend code.

### 10. UML Diagrams
- **What**: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) + System architecture.
- **Why**: Helps explain database and API relationships in interviews.
- **How**: Provided in `uml/` folder.

## Why These Features Are Useful in Real Projects

- **Security (JWT)** → Makes project deployable in production.  
- **Logging** → Provides observability, critical for debugging.  
- **Indexed Queries** → Ensures project scales with more data.  
- **Visualization** → Communicates insights to non-technical stakeholders.  
- **Dockerization** → Saves setup time for collaborators and recruiters.  
- **Documentation** → Shows professionalism and makes APIs reusable.  

This combination demonstrates both **engineering fundamentals** and **industry best practices**.
